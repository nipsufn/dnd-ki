# Notes for a DnD campaign 

![Build Status](https://github.com/nipsufn/dnd-ki/actions/workflows/parse-n-push.yml/badge.svg)

Files (contents in Polish) are implicitly cross-referenced to make putting notes down easier.
To make references work, files have to be viewed via [journal.html](https://github.com/nipsufn/nipsufn.github.io/blob/master/journal.html)

Syntax and cross-references can be validated with [test.py](https://github.com/nipsufn/dnd-ki/blob/master/test.py).
