# Notes for a DnD campaign 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nipsufn/dnd-ki-source.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nipsufn/dnd-ki-source)

Files (contents in Polish) are implicitly crossreferenced to make putting notes down easier.
To make references work, files have to be viewed via [jounal.html](https://github.com/nipsufn/nipsufn.github.io/blob/master/journal.html)

Syntax and crossreferences can be validated with [test.py](https://github.com/nipsufn/dnd-ki/blob/master/test.py).
